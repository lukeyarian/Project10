## Notes

This app went a little smoother than some other apps in the developing process. However, I got stuck on the sensors activity and I'm not sure it is completely meeting all of the requirements. I also was stuck for a while on the Google
Play testing track portion of the assignnment. ADD: I can't figure out how to create a keystore and realized that is costs $25 to create an account just to publish this one app. -20!
